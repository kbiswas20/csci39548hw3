      Nepali Momo Cafe is a small restaurant that serves Nepalese and Himalayan cuisine. We offer a variety of options, but we are most known for our momos.
      We make all of our food right here, and we pride ourselves in using authentic spices and ingredients. We hope to spread these foods to all cultures and offer a rich yet unique dining experience.
